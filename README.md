# Titanic VR mod

What you see here is a mod for the game Titanic VR. You can download it in the release section.

It allows the player with a single press on the 'o'-key to toggle the mod on and off at runtime.
When activated, the following things are changed:
- light settings changed in order to light up the whole wreck and ocean floor
- "fog" deactivated, now you can look over the whole map
- shaders adapted for sharper look
- speed of submarine increased
- speed of ROV increased
- maximum distance of ROV unlimited, so you can go away from the submarine as far as you want

I decided to not publish the code in order to not get into trouble with the developers.

# Installation
It is simple, all you have to do is to replace a single file. Go to your installation folder and look for:
Titanic VR\TitanicVR_Data\Managed

In the Managed folder is a .dll file called "Assembly-CSharp.dll".
I suggest you to make a backup from it. You can either rename it or move it to another folder, so you can always uninstall the mod by just putting the file back.
After you have secured the  "Assembly-CSharp.dll" you can now put the new .dll file from the latest mod release in there, which is also called "Assembly-CSharp.dll". It is important to keep this specific file name.

Thats all. After you have replaced the "Assembly-CSharp.dll" you can start up your game, go to sandbox mode and press they key 'o' to toggle the mod on and off.

Have fun!
